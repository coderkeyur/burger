# burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. 

Once the user clicks  Devour it! button, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

All the burger entries are saved in database, whether devoured or not.
